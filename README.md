# Semantic Map

This is a Python3 module for creating and modifying semantic maps.

## Roadmap

- [ ] github tests
- [ ] use openTSNE instead of sklearn -- fails when there's many items ("IndexError: Vector has wrong length (expected 300, got 1000)")
- [ ] iterative projection (add-item) with opeTSNE and UMAP
- [ ] OOV
- [ ] annoy instead of pymagnitude
